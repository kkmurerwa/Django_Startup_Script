# Django Startup Script for Windows
This repo contains a batch file that automates the creation of new Django projects on Windows.

## What it does
1. Creates a folder for a new project
2. Creates a virtual environment for you with the latest Django version
3. Runs startproject config
4. Performs migration
5. (Optional) Creates any number of apps you want to create
6. (Optional) Adds urls.py files to each app created


## Prerequisites
In order to utilize this script, you have to have
1. Python 3.* installed.
2. Pipenv installed on your Windows computer.

## Instructions for use
I highly doubt you will need instructions for this script. It involves a lot of prompts and provides output for every step it takes in the process


## Disclaimer
As usual, there is usually a different structure that every developer uses. That is also the case with this batch script. It is made to suit the structure I have adopted for Django Projects.
